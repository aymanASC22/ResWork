				<h2>Networking Basics</h2>
						<h3>DON'T WAIT TO START NETWORKING!</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Start networking before you need it! If you do not maintain connections throughout your career and only look for them when you need them then you will have a hard time finding them. If you continuously maintain connections and network, then you can build relationships that will be useful in the future. However, if you only network when you need something, not only will you have trouble making connections, but these connections will not be as deep as they could be.</li>
						</ul>
					<h3>HAVE A PLAN</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Go into networking with a game plan. Networking is not simply just talking. You have to be able to market yourself to others, as well as decipher what people can do for you.</li>
						</ul>
					<h3>DON'T BE BLINDED</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>A game plan is important, BUT do not focus on your personal agenda. You may have a goal in mind, be it a certain position or job, but if you focus solely on that one goal you will miss other opportunities that may come your way.</li>
						</ul>
					<h3>BE OPEN!</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Therefore, you must be open to everyone! People can help you in mysterious ways that may not seem apparent at first. So, you should not turn anyone away without giving them a chance first.</li>
							</ul>
