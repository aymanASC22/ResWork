		<h2>Resume Writing 101</h2>
		<h3>MAIN POINT:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Your resume should stand out, but also be clear and concise.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>FORMATTING</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The FIRST THING on your resume should be your basic information, i.e. your name, number, email, and
				Linkedin or GitHub is applicable.</li>
			<li>The top third of your resume should be utilized the most! Employers will not want to read the rest of
				your resume if it doesn't pull them in at first.</li>
			<li>An objective can be added in this area as well if you are experiencing a career change.</li>
			<li>More valuable than an objective, however, is a "snapshot." Essentially, you can try to capture yourself
				and what you can offer to the prospective employer if you are hired.</li>
		</ul>
		<div id="formatting-container">
			<div id="formatting-text">
				<ul>
					<h4>Experience:</h4>
					<li>The next section of your resume should detail your experience.</li>
					<li>This includes, but is not limited to, previous employment, internships, volunteer work, and
						other opportunities.</li>
					<li>Try to emphasize what is most applicable to the position you are applying for.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<h4>Education</h4>
					<li>The education section should have a list of all completed school levels starting from high
						school.</li>
					<li>The list should go from highest level of education, to lowest level.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<h4>Skills & Abilities</h4>
					<li>Include a list of any skills that not only show your strengths for the position, but skills that
						also make you stand out from the pool of applicants.</li>
					<li>This can span from languages you speak, to softwares you are efficient in (such as coding
						languages or Microsoft Office), to any extra credentials you have.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>STYLISTIC CHOICES</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>It may seem trivial, but stylistic choices for your resume go a long way.</li>
					<li>You should always keep in mind that you want to present a professional image of yourself. This
						is done with a professional font, using academic language instead of slang, and clear
						organization.</li>
				</ul>

		<h3>GENERAL ADVICE</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Make sure your information is relevant to the position you want!</li>
			<li>Whatever is more relevant should be listed higher on your resume.</li>
			<li>Use a lot of keywords, such as action verbs, and a lot of numbers and statistics!</li>
			<li>Many companies use computer programs to get through many applications at once, therefore not only is
				using keywords important, but so is making your resume easy to read!</li>
			<li>Avoid cluttering your resume with unnecessary words.</li>
			<li>Make sure everything is as brief as possible without taking away the essence of what you want to show.
			</li>
			<li>Only use sections that you need! The template is not a definitive outline. If you believe that a certain
				section does not apply to you or is not necessary, do not be afraid to leave it out!</li>
			<li>Make sure to proofread your resume for spelling and grammatical errors! It is not a good look to have
				simple mistakes.</li>
			<li>Overall, do not think you have to use the same resume for every application. It is okay to tweak certain
				things to make it more applicable for the position you want.</li>
		</ul>
